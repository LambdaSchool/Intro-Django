I made an app called "travelous" to hold a list foreign countries to visit.
Ignore "travelust" as that was a preliminary implementation that does not work.

There is a Country class and a City subclass.

- **Country class has:**
- id = unique identifier for each country
- country = the name of the country
- capital = the capital of the country
- visited = if I have visited the country
- wiki = the wikipedia link to the wikipedia page
- created_at = the time the country was created
- last_modified =  the last time the country was modified
