# models.Model
#   gives Django functionality 
#   eg access to fields such as UUIDField,Charfield, TextField, URLField

# The difference between ./manage.py shell and pipenv shell
#   think of scope locality

# One advantage to using Django, you can create data quick and easily in the ./manage.py shell
# Normally users would delete records manually through the GUI, but we can do it faster by filtering certain ID's in the shell
