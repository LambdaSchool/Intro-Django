I think having a full deployment based sprint was a very good idea. In the past, it's just been tacked on so I think it was good to get a whole day with it., even though each project is different.

I had a lot of little errors and it was death by 1k paper cuts. But, that's been par for the course all week.

I had trouble deploying intially because, despite the vivid memory of doing it, cors wasn't actually installed, so once I figured that out, I had to fix my Procfile and re-deploy because I'd set that up incorrectly as well, but otherwise that was it. It just took quite a while to figure out that was causing my problems.
