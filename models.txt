Hi,

If you're reading this that must mean you want to know what you can store in this api!

There is only one table and here are it's properties:

- id : UUID and auto generated per project
- project_title: a string that is at max 200 characters
- created_at: an automatically created time stamp
- last_modified: the last time the the database was changed as a date time object automatically generated
- description: a text field of any size that descripts the purpose of the project
- current_stage: a string that is at max 200 characters describing what stage the project is in
- plan_board: a url field, may be blank, link to trello or whatever
- repo: a url field, may be blank, link to github or whatever
- user: a string, a foreignkey, and determines who the project shows for


There is now a second table! It's for users:

To make a new user you should just have to post:

- username: string
- password: also a string
