"""
There are 4 types of data that are being stored in our smurf database.
ID, Text, Number, and Date/Time.

UUIDField used in 'id' is a char(32) data type.
It creates a text column, where the length is fixed at 32 characters.

CharField used in 'name' is a varchar(50) data type.
It creates a text column, where the max_length argument is required 
to specify the maximum length in characters. 
In this case, it has been limited to upto 50 characters.

PositiveSmallIntegerField used in 'age' and 'size' are number data types,
more specifically, smallint unsigned data types.
They enforce values from 0 to 32767.
It works just like IntegerField, which takes in an integer / number value,
but the specialized PositiveIntegerField limits numbers to a smaller positive range.

DateTimeField used for 'created_at' and 'last_modified' are datetime data types.
They create a datetime field to store dates with times.
