Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path

                                        # without needing to add them to urlpatterns
    re_path(r'^api-token-auth/', views.obtain_auth_token) # add the endpoint
        # The ^ is means "match the beginning of the string" in a regular expression
        # The re_path function is just like path, except it interprets the endpoint as a regex instead of a fixed string
