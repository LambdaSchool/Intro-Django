Heroku app: https://lssprint.herokuapp.com/admin/login/?next=/admin/

I successfully deployed the project to Heroku after running into several issues. I had to fix the Procfile as I incorrectly named it after the heroku app instead of "djorg". I had to read the documention about whitenoise to figure out its functionality. During the deployment process, I received several errors, which I was able to identify and solve them with the help of my PM and others in my group.
