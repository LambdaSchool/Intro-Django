This week was indeed challenging for me. I feel that I have learned more during this week than the previous weeks combined. Since I had started out with a migration problem, I learned a lot about

    * making new github branches
    * and merging the old + new branches
    * making a new remote

in order to fix the issue. I fixed it by simply re-doing the assignment and committing the new chnages to my new branch. In addition, I learned more about just how to navigate through the powershell and learned new commands in general.

When it came to tackling the sprint challenge, I started of a bit rocky and had actually done the right steps but in the wrong repo. So I was able to get a PM to assist me in correcting some of my minor mistakes.

I was able to follow the instructions and do some troubleshooting to get around some errors. I feel that is one skill I'm getting a bit better at and enjoy a little. I like sharpening my google fu and finding some solution and then testing it and it works is a great feeling to have.

The tricky parts would be not knowing for sure if certain pieces of code will work or if you need any extra piece of code at all. Sure the documentation can guide you to say whether or not you need it, but I guess it depends on programmer and the overall project.

Overall, a stressful and yet enjoyable week.
